CMake Warning (dev) in CMakeLists.txt:
  No project() command is present.  The top-level CMakeLists.txt file must
  contain a literal, direct call to the project() command.  Add a line of
  code such as

    project(ProjectName)

  near the top of the file, but after cmake_minimum_required().

  CMake is pretending there is a "project(Project)" command on the first
  line.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Warning (dev) in CMakeLists.txt:
  cmake_minimum_required() should be called prior to this top-level project()
  call.  Please see the cmake-commands(7) manual for usage documentation of
  both commands.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:16 (cmake_minimum_required):
  Compatibility with CMake < 3.5 will be removed from a future version of
  CMake.

  Update the VERSION argument <min> value or use a ...<max> suffix to tell
  CMake that the project does not need compatibility with older versions.


CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:39 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindBASIS.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "BASIS", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "BASIS" with any of
  the following names:

    BASISConfig.cmake
    basis-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "BASIS" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "BASIS_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "BASIS"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.


CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:44 (message):
  BASIS not found! Please specify installation directory of BASIS or the
  location of the BASISConfig.cmake file using the BASIS_DIR variable.


-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
